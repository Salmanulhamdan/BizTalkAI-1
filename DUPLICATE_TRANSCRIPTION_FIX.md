# Duplicate Transcription Fix

## Problem
The system was showing **duplicate transcriptions** for user speech:
- One from **OpenAI Realtime API** (real-time streaming)
- One from **Local Whisper API** (parallel processing)

This created confusion and cluttered the chat interface.

## Solution
I've implemented a **separation of responsibilities**:

### ✅ **User Speech Transcription**
- **ONLY** Local Whisper API handles user speech transcription
- **DISABLED** OpenAI Realtime user transcription to prevent duplicates
- Shows as "Local Transcription" with confidence scores

### ✅ **AI Response Transcription** 
- **ONLY** OpenAI Realtime API handles AI response transcription
- Shows as "AI Response" 

## Changes Made

### 1. **Disabled OpenAI Realtime User Transcription**
```typescript
// In useWebRTCVoice.ts - DISABLED all user transcription events:
if (data.type === "conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.completed") {
  // addTranscriptionMessage("You", transcript); // DISABLED
}
```

### 2. **Disabled Input Audio Transcription in Session Config**
```typescript
// Removed input_audio_transcription from session config:
// input_audio_transcription: {
//   model: "whisper-1"
// },
```

### 3. **Updated UI Labels**
- **"Local Transcription"** for user speech (from Whisper)
- **"AI Response"** for AI responses (from Realtime API)
- **"Recording your speech..."** status indicator
- **"Transcribing your speech..."** processing indicator

### 4. **Clear Separation of Audio Processing**

**Path A - Real-time Streaming (AI Processing Only):**
- Audio sent to OpenAI for AI response generation
- NO user transcription (disabled)
- Only handles AI response transcription

**Path B - Local Whisper (User Speech Only):**
- MediaRecorder captures user speech
- Local Whisper API transcribes user speech
- Immediate local feedback with confidence scores

## Result

### ✅ **Before (Problem):**
```
You: "Hello, how are you?" (Voice)
You: "Hello, how are you?" (Local Voice)  ← DUPLICATE!
Efa: "I'm doing well, thank you!" (Voice)
```

### ✅ **After (Fixed):**
```
You: "Hello, how are you?" (Local Transcription - 95%)
Efa: "I'm doing well, thank you!" (AI Response)
```

## Benefits

1. **No More Duplicates**: Each speech is transcribed only once
2. **Clear Source Identification**: Users know which system transcribed what
3. **Better Performance**: Reduced API calls and processing
4. **Improved UX**: Cleaner chat interface with clear indicators
5. **Confidence Scores**: Local transcriptions show accuracy percentages

## Technical Details

- **User Speech**: Local Whisper API (immediate, with confidence)
- **AI Responses**: OpenAI Realtime API (real-time streaming)
- **Audio Processing**: Both systems receive the same audio stream
- **Transcription**: Only one system handles each type of speech
- **UI Indicators**: Clear labels distinguish transcription sources

The system now provides a clean, non-duplicated transcription experience with clear source identification and confidence metrics for user speech.
